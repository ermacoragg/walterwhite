					My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I found
					out he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was going to happen
					soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought about
					a lot of stuff. Things I hadn't thought about for a long
					time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I kind of took him for granted or
					something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, our parents are just always
					there.&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect them to always be bugging you to clean
					up your room or study harder or have good manners or try new things
					to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
					make you get up early on the weekend to have "family time" and all
					that other stuff that used to drive me crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't
					feel that way now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's different since Dad got
					his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I realized that one day in the near
					future, he might not be around to drive me crazy. <br />

					<p>My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's
						annoyingly smart. I mean, super brainiac annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;He
						knows the most random stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like how at room
						temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form. And
						water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's
						frozen it takes up about 9% more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you
						slowly pour a handful of salt into a totally full glass of water,
						it won't overflow. In fact, the water level will go
						down.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always dropping the little facts about
						everything. He doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it,
						he's just really into chemistry. I think he really doesn't
						understand that not everybody is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to cook
						because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says
						chemi- cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's
						always explaining as he goes. I don't take his class at school but
						I hear he's a pretty good teacher. He gets a lot of practice at
						home, that's for sure.</p>

					<p class="small-copy white">The whole time I've been in high school
						(I'm a sophomore) I've always had to hear what other kids thought
						of him. I was always Mr White's kid. (Sometimes they call him Mr.
						Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser shoes he always
						wears).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.
						Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with
						teachers. The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their
						best just like he does, and when you don't try your hardest he
						doesn't cut you any slack. That's how he is at home and at
						school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only just figured out what a good qual- ity
						that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what
						made me brave, too when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I wanted
						to be or not. Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid
						in school but because of my dad being a teacher there I was
						different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize two things now. First, I am
						already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal. And
						two, he's the right dad for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't do a lot of
						physical stuff be- cause of my disability and that's okay with my
						dad and it wouldn't be with a lot of other dads I've
						met.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be disappointed because they're into sports
						or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability
						but you sure wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that
						way, we get along. It makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his
						son. My point is, I don't care about what the kids at school say
						anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is he's a good teacher and no
						one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he
						cares.&nbsp;&nbsp;After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is
						what he loves the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to make sure he
						gets to keep doing what he loves to do for a long
						time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, for his students, and for me and my
						family.</p>
